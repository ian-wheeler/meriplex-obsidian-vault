Highest Priority -- This is Speed

- Spark form should create an opportunity directly in SF and CW and link them
	- as opposed to creating a Case in Salesforce which does not link to the opportunity or a corresponding ticket in ConnectWise
	- additionally we can deprecate the need to create tickets in ConnectWise for NRR quote requests if we write back the opportunity URL to Salesforce as opposed to the ticket URL
- Drop-down list for required fields as well as ability to create new sites and contacts
- Route the opportunity to the solutions consultant (based on the teams tab in ConnectWise)
	- if there is no Solutions Consultant or it's a New Logo, assign the case to John Powell 
	- applies to all unassigned account (*no solutions consultant*), 
- On home screen in Salesforce have a notification pod and leverage the pod for notifications (if exists else tasks pod to address new opportunities is fine).
- Include notifications for the following:
	- Quote requested
	- Opportunity Created
	- Opportunity Quoted
	- Quote Delivered
	- Quote Signed
	- Order Placed
	- Order Received
- IF T&M Only? is checked then it bypasses salesforce etc., and creates a ticket on the following board:
	 - [ ] `Prof-Svcs`
- Get with Brian, do we need to even create tickets for NRR? Reporting purposes etc.?
- Force the campaign and requester name fields in addition to the other required fields for converting a spark form request to a CW/SF Opportunity

quote requested via spark form
is request time and materials only?
is request new logo?
does request have solutions consultant (according to ConnectWise Teams tab)?
