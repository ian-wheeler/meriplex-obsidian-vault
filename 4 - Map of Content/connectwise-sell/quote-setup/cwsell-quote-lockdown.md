This article provides you with details on how to lock down a quote after it has been approved. Refer to [Quote Versions](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/300/020/010/030 "Quote Versions") for more information. 
## Additional Details:

- The quote is locked down after approval is downloaded from Order Porter™.
- Win! tab options are editable after the quote is locked down. 
- When you create a new version of a locked quote, the customer approval is cleared. Therefore, the quote needs to be re-approved by the customer.
