# Locations Overview
---
Locations enables you to create location settings for each location of your company and displays location information, company name, time zone and logos on quotes based on the location selected. Location information is tied to each user in ConnectWise CPQ™ (Sell) so that all quotes a user creates default to display their location information. A user can change the location on an individual quote if needed. You can add a different logo for each location. Refer to [Logo and Image Specifications](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/050/170 "Logo and Image Specifications") for more information on logo specifications.

**Tip:** To locate this screen navigate to **Settings > Organization Setup > Locations**.
