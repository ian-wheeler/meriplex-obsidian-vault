## SSO Setup

After you have set up an administrator account with the [ConnectWise Home](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Unified_Product/ConnectWise_Home "ConnectWise Home"), you can set up your ConnectWise SSO connection with ConnectWise CPQ (Sell). Any CPQ usernames that do not have an SSO account are submitted to the ConnectWise Home and an email is sent to them so they can sign up. Refer to [SSO Setup](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/800/010/040/SSO_Setup_for_ConnectWise_CPQ "https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/800/010/060") for CPQ for instructions on how to set up ConnectWise SSO.
