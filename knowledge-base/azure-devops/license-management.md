# License Management Strategy

**To consider:**

- What phase are you in?
- How many people are using the feature?
- How long are you willing to wait if in the queue for pipelines? Is this urgent? Is this a validation only?
- Should all users access all features? Are they Stakeholders? Basic users? Do they already have a Visual Studio license?
- Do you have an advanced Package Management strategy? Maybe you need more space for Artifacts.
