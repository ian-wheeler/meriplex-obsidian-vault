<h2 id="description">## Description</h2>
<p>District staff are expected to report to different stakeholders (Board of Directors Committees and others) on different subjects through various public meetings. This document outlines the process of submitting and reviewing staff reports that are to be presented in public meetings. ## Regular Public Meetings — The District currently hosts the following meetings on a regular basis:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Engineering &amp; Operations Committee Meeting</strong>: First Monday of Every Month</li>
<li><strong>Administration &amp; Finance Committee Meeting</strong>: Second Monday of Every Month</li>
<li><strong>Regular Board Meetings</strong>: Second and Fourth Thursday of Every Month</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly JRWSS Member Agency Meeting</strong>: Once Per Quarter</li>
<li><strong>South Laguna Water/Sewer Advisory Committee Meeting</strong>: Once Per Quarter</li>
<li><strong>Special Board Meetings</strong>: Scheduled as Needed ## Report Timeline — Generally, staff reports must be completed by departments at least three weeks prior to each meeting (see “Staff Report Due Dates” as Attachment A). It is important that staff account for review time at the department level prior to the three weeks required for external review. All staff have a workflow specific to them built into Microsoft Teams and have an option to select their supervisor/manager as the first reviewer for their staff reports. Department supervisors/managers will review and “accept” reports in Teams which will trigger an alert to individuals outside of their department to begin the official three-week review process. Reports will be submitted to the following parties in the given timeline:</li>
</ul>
<p>[[9199134-timeline.png]] ## Editing Staff Reports — Upon receiving staff reports, staff listed above will have one (1) week to review reports, make edits and/or add review comments using track-changes. Upon completing their review, reviewers must “Accept” staff reports in “Teams” and inform staff whether edits/review comments were entered into the file for their review. Staff will receive a notification via Teams alerting them of the status of their reports.</p>
<p>Creators of each staff report will have access to their reports throughout the entire review process. Staff are responsible for accepting, declining, and making recommended edits throughout the process. Staff reports must be completely edited/cleaned up after the General Manager has reviewed the report. Staff must then inform the Admin Group (Executive Services Manager Jody Brennan and Senior Administrative Assistant Leilani Ayers) that their staff report has been finalized.</p>
<p>[[9199134-teams-notification.png]] ## Final Steps — Upon being notified that staff reports have been finalized, the Admin Group will complete any formatting edits required and create a meeting packet which they will distribute to Board members and other stakeholders for review one week prior to each meeting. The official meeting agenda and attachments must be posted to Granicus 72 hours prior to the meeting to ensure compliance with the Brown Act.</p>
