Configure User Access When adding a new user to ConnectWise CPQ, the first step is to configure their user page. Details like login credentials and contact information enable access to the application and determine how user details are presented to the customer when creating quotes. This screen is also where you configure security settings that control what actions the user can take within ConnectWise CPQ.</p>
<p>To grant seamless access to not only ConnectWise CPQ but also other products and services through ConnectWise Home, we recommend also completing the ConnectWise SSO user setup. #### CPQ User Setup 1. Navigate to Settings &gt; Organization Setup &gt; Users. 2. Click Add. 3. Enter details for the user, including user name, first name, last name, presented name, job title, email address, picture, and time zone. 4. On the left of the screen, review and select checkboxes to assign the appropriate security access. Refer to the <a href="https://university.connectwise.com/university/pageview.aspx?short_name=sell-permission-matrix">CPQ Permission Matrix</a> for additional details. 5. Click Save. 6. Enter a New Password, Confirm New Password, and then click Change Password.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Use the Impersonate User button at the top right of the screen to test security settings applied to a user. To end the impersonation session, click the user avatar at the top right corner of the screen and select End Impersonation from the drop-down menu. #### Optional: ConnectWise SSO User Setup 1.

<h3 id="connect-cpq-and-crm-accounts">2. Connect CPQ and CRM Accounts</h3>
<p>Now that the user has access to CPQ, it’s time to connect that user account to your CRM tool. Configuring the CRM integration for a user in CPQ allows them to access the customers, opportunities, and products stored in your CRM database. This configuration is critical, as it enables the user to quickly build quotes from CRM records and allows CPQ to update CRM records throughout the sales cycle. ### Steps 1. Navigate to Settings &gt; Organization Setup &gt; Users. 2. Click the Edit icon next to the User Name. 3. Click Impersonate User. 4. Navigate to Settings &gt; CRM Integration &gt; Manage Credentials (if using ConnectWise PSA).<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The name of the credential screen depends on the provider selected in the Settings &gt; CRM Integration &gt; CRM Provider screen. These exact steps may differ depending on your CRM. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/800/030">CRM Integration</a> documentation for specific instructions. 5. Enter the users PSA credentials and then click Check Login. 6. Click Save. 7. Click the user avatar in the top right corner of the screen and select End Impersonation from the drop-down menu.</p>
<h3 id="enable-sending-quotes">3. Enable Sending Quotes</h3>
<p>Configuring the Email Server screen per user allows ConnectWise CPQ to send emails on the users’ behalf. This is primarily used to ensure successful delivery of quotes to customers.</p>
<p>To ensure that only high-quality quotes are delivered to your customers, we recommend assigning the sales rep to a sales team, which controls the quote templates available to the user, and establishing an approval rule to funnel their quotes to the appropriate resource for review before sending. ### Steps #### Email Integration Setup 1. Navigate to Settings &gt; Organization Setup &gt; Users. 2. Click the Edit icon next to the User Name. 3. Click Impersonate User. 4. Navigate to Settings &gt; Workflow Integrations &gt; Email Server. 5. Enter the user specific details into the configuration pod for your email provider.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> These exact steps may differ depending on your email provider. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/800/070/005">Email Server</a> documentation for specific instructions. 6. Select the Use [email provider name] checkbox. 7. Click Save. 8. Click Test Email. 9. Click the user avatar at the top right corner of the screen and select End Impersonation from the drop-down menu. #### Optional: Sales Team Assignment 1. Navigate to Settings &gt; Organization Setup &gt; Users. 2. Click the Edit icon next to the User Name. 3. Select the team name from the Team Profile drop-down. 4. Click Save.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Team settings, like available quote templates, can be edited from the Settings &gt; Organization Setup &gt; Teams screen. #### Optional: Quote Approval Setup 1. Navigate to Settings &gt; Approvals &gt; Rules. 2. Scroll to the Rules Shortcuts pod. 3. Select the individual’s User Name in the When created by drop-down. 4. Click CREATE to generate the rule. This adds a new rule to the list called “Review [User Name].” 5. Select the Edit icon beside the new rule. 6. Edit settings to select the individual or team responsible for reviewing and approving the quotes created by this user. 7. Click SAVE.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> To use this feature, you must have the Multi-Level Quote Approval Mode selected in Settings &gt; Approvals &gt; Setup.</p>
<h3 id="confirm-university-access">4. Confirm University Access</h3>
<p>Now that your new team member is ready to use CPQ, it’s critical to help them get the most out of it! The ConnectWise University contains documentation, short how-to videos, process blueprints (like this one) and more to help support their learning. We highly recommend exposing new CPQ users to the <a href="https://university.connectwise.com/university/pageview.aspx?short_name=paths-to-product-proficiency-sales-and-marketing#sales_rep">Paths to Product Proficiency: Sales and Marketing</a> Sales Representative track, which covers product features and processes that are critical to their success.</p>
<p>Additionally, the University contains product-specific degrees made up of lessons to help them master product features. We recommend assigning a degree to new users, which allows you to track their progress through the coursework and supplement any on-the-job training your organization provides. ### Steps #### University Access 1. Navigate to home.connectwise.com. 2. Log in and then navigate to the Users &amp; Application Settings screen. 3. Select the user you wish to grant access to the university. 4.
