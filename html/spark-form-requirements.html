<p>Highest Priority – This is Speed</p>
<ul>
<li>Spark form should create an opportunity directly in SF and CW and link them
<ul>
<li>as opposed to creating a Case in Salesforce which does not link to the opportunity or a corresponding ticket in ConnectWise</li>
<li>additionally we can deprecate the need to create tickets in ConnectWise for NRR quote requests if we write back the opportunity URL to Salesforce as opposed to the ticket URL</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drop-down list for required fields as well as ability to create new sites and contacts</li>
<li>Route the opportunity to the solutions consultant (based on the teams tab in ConnectWise)
<ul>
<li>if there is no Solutions Consultant or it’s a New Logo, assign the case to John Powell</li>
<li>applies to all unassigned account (<em>no solutions consultant</em>),</li>
</ul></li>
<li>On home screen in Salesforce have a notification pod and leverage the pod for notifications (if exists else tasks pod to address new opportunities is fine).</li>
<li>Include notifications for the following:
<ul>
<li>Quote requested</li>
<li>Opportunity Created</li>
<li>Opportunity Quoted</li>
<li>Quote Delivered</li>
<li>Quote Signed</li>
<li>Order Placed</li>
<li>Order Received</li>
</ul></li>
<li>IF T&amp;M Only? is checked then it bypasses salesforce etc., and creates a ticket on the following board:
<ul class="task-list">
<li><input type="checkbox" disabled="" />
<code>Prof-Svcs</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Get with Brian, do we need to even create tickets for NRR? Reporting purposes etc.?</li>
<li>Force the campaign and requester name fields in addition to the other required fields for converting a spark form request to a CW/SF Opportunity</li>
</ul>
<p>quote requested via spark form is request time and materials only? is request new logo? does request have solutions consultant (according to ConnectWise Teams tab)?</p>
