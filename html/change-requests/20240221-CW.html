</ul>
<p><strong>Reason for Change:</strong> The proposed changes aim to better reflect the variety of financial impacts for <code>Agreement Additions</code> and selections that can be made for each addition within an agreement. This will enhance the accuracy of our financial reporting and ensure consistent terminology is used throughout the system.</p>
<p><strong>Impact Analysis:</strong> The requested changes are anticipated to improve the user interface by providing clearer options that align with the defined terms. This is expected to reduce user error and enhance data integrity for financial reporting purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All changes should be thoroughly tested in the development environment before being rolled out to the production environment.</li>

<li>Confirm the request with Werner and Glenn
