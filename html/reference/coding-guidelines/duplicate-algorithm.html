<h1 id="duplicate-algorithm">Duplicate Algorithm</h1>
<p>To identify potential duplicates in Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems using the fields you mentioned, a common approach involves a combination of fuzzy matching and exact matching techniques. Here’s a breakdown of how you might use these techniques with the specific fields:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Exact Matching</strong>: Some fields may be suited for exact matching if they are typically unique or standardized. Fields such as <code>Id</code>, <code>Company_Rec_ID__c</code>, and <code>Company_ID__c</code> can be used for exact matches because these are likely to be unique identifiers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fuzzy Matching</strong>: For fields like <code>Name</code>, <code>BillingAddress</code>, <code>ShippingAddress</code>, <code>Website</code>, and <code>Phone</code>, fuzzy matching can be more effective. This involves using algorithms that can find matches that are similar but not exactly the same, accounting for common variations or errors in data entry.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some specific algorithms and techniques you might use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Levenshtein Distance (Edit Distance)</strong>: This is useful for text fields such as <code>Name</code>, <code>BillingAddress</code>, and <code>ShippingAddress</code>. It measures the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jaro-Winkler</strong>: This algorithm is effective for shorter strings such as names where more common errors might be transpositions or typos. It is particularly good at catching these types of mistakes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Cosine Similarity</strong>: This could be used for longer text fields or lists of words, such as might be found in addresses or company names.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phonetic Matching</strong>: Algorithms like Soundex or Metaphone can be used for the <code>Name</code> and <code>Company</code> fields, as they reduce words to a phonetic code and compare these codes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Record Linkage</strong>: This is a more comprehensive approach where multiple fields are used in conjunction to assess the probability that two records refer to the same entity. Techniques like weighted scoring can be used where matches on fields that are more likely to be unique (like <code>Phone</code> or <code>Website</code>) are given higher importance.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Data Standardization</strong>: Before applying these algorithms, it’s crucial to standardize the data, especially for fields like addresses and phone numbers. This includes formatting phone numbers and addresses consistently, removing or standardizing prefixes and suffixes in names, and using consistent case (e.g., all lowercase).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Threshold Setting</strong>: Determine a threshold for match scoring. Records that score above this threshold could be considered duplicates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Software and Libraries</strong>: Implement these algorithms using data processing libraries in Python like <code>pandas</code> for handling data, and <code>fuzzywuzzy</code> or <code>python-Levenshtein</code> for fuzzy matching. For more sophisticated record linkage, the <code>recordlinkage</code> Python package can be very useful.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Combining these methods allows you to effectively identify potential duplicates across the different fields in a CRM system, improving data integrity and operational efficiency.</p>
