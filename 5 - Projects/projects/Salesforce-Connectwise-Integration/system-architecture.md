### System Architecture for Salesforce and ConnectWise Integration

#### Overview

The system integrates Salesforce and ConnectWise using Hookdeck to catch webhooks/events and custom middleware to handle data transformations, routing logic, and event processing. The architecture ensures real-time and reliable synchronization between the two systems.

The integration design incorporates **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)** as the overarching architectural style. It uses the **Mediator Pattern** for centralized control of communication, the **Publish-Subscribe Pattern** for handling webhooks/events, the **Observer Pattern** for listening to database changes, and **Queue-Based Messaging** for reliable event processing. This combination ensures a decoupled, scalable, and maintainable integration between Salesforce and ConnectWise.

#### Components

1. **Salesforce**
    - **Webhooks:** Salesforce sends events (e.g., updates, new records) via webhooks to Hookdeck.

2. **Hookdeck**
    - **Webhook Handler:** Catches webhooks from Salesforce and forwards them to the middleware.

3. **Middleware**
    - **Event Processor:** Receives events from Hookdeck and the ConnectWise database queue.
    - **Data Transformer:** Transforms the data to the required format for the target system.
    - **Router:** Determines the target system (Salesforce or ConnectWise) based on event type and business logic.
    - **Connector:** Pushes events/updates to the appropriate system (Salesforce or ConnectWise).

4. **ConnectWise**
    - **API/Webhooks:** Receives updates/events from the middleware.
    - **Database Listener:** A stored procedure listens for specific changes/events in the ConnectWise database.
    - **Event Queue:** Stores events captured by the database listener for processing by the middleware.

5. **Event Queue (in ConnectWise Database)**
    - **Queue Table:** Stores events that do not have webhooks. The middleware polls this table to process these events.

#### Data Flow

1. **Salesforce to ConnectWise:**
    - Salesforce generates an event (e.g., new record, update).
    - The event is sent to Hookdeck via a webhook.
    - Hookdeck forwards the event to the middleware.
    - The middleware processes the event, transforms the data, and routes it to ConnectWise.
    - The middleware pushes the transformed data to ConnectWise via its API.

2. **ConnectWise to Salesforce:**
    - ConnectWise generates an event (e.g., new record, update).
    - If the event has a webhook, it is sent directly to the middleware.
    - If the event does not have a webhook, a stored procedure captures it and places it in the event queue.
    - The middleware polls the event queue, processes the event, transforms the data, and routes it to Salesforce.
    - The middleware pushes the transformed data to Salesforce via its API.

3. **Database Listener and Event Queue:**
    - A stored procedure in the ConnectWise database listens for changes.
    - Relevant changes are placed into a queue table.
    - The middleware regularly polls the queue table, processes the queued events, and forwards them to the appropriate system.

#### Technologies Used

- **Salesforce:** For CRM data and webhook generation.
- **Hookdeck:** For capturing and forwarding webhooks.
- **Custom Middleware:** Built with a programming language suitable for handling HTTP requests, data transformation, and routing (e.g., Node.js, Python).
- **ConnectWise:** For managing service data and generating events.
- **Database (e.g., SQL Server):** For storing event queue and executing stored procedures.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Salesforce Webhook Configuration:**
    - Configure Salesforce to send webhooks to Hookdeck on specific events.

2. **Hookdeck Setup:**
    - Set up Hookdeck to receive webhooks from Salesforce and forward them to the middleware endpoint.

3. **Middleware Implementation:**
    - Implement an HTTP server in the middleware to receive webhook events from Hookdeck.
    - Implement data transformation logic to convert Salesforce data to ConnectWise format and vice versa.
    - Implement routing logic to determine the target system for each event.
    - Implement connectors to push data to Salesforce and ConnectWise via their APIs.

4. **ConnectWise Database Listener:**
    - Implement a stored procedure in the ConnectWise database to listen for specific events.
    - Store these events in a queue table for processing by the middleware.

5. **Middleware Queue Polling:**
    - Implement polling logic in the middleware to regularly check the ConnectWise database queue.
    - Process and route queued events to the appropriate system.

This architecture ensures a robust, decoupled, and scalable integration between Salesforce and ConnectWise, facilitating real-time data synchronization and reliable event handling.
