# General Data Science and Analytics Repository

This repository contains resources for general data science and analytics tasks. It includes shared data, notebooks, scripts, and models that can be used across multiple projects. The structure is designed to keep everything organized and easily accessible.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains all data files
    
    - **raw/**: Raw, unprocessed data files (e.g., CSV, JSON, Excel)
    - **processed/**: Cleaned and transformed data ready for analysis
    - **external/**: Data from external sources such as public datasets or APIs
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks
    
    - **exploration/**: Notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA)
    - **analysis/**: Notebooks for in-depth analysis and modeling
    - **reports/**: Finalized notebooks for reporting and presentation
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data processing, analysis, and modeling
    
- **models/**: Saved models and related files
    
- **myenv/**: Virtual environment directory (included for completeness, typically this would be excluded from version control)
    
- **Dockerfile**: Dockerfile for setting up the development environment
    
- **README.md**: This README file
    
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for the repository
    
- **.gitignore**: Git ignore file
    

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
- **Docker**: If you want to use Docker for your development environment.

### Setting Up the Virtual Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `git clone <repository-url> cd cursor-ipynb-general-20240603`
    
2. **Set up the virtual environment**:
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `python -m venv myenv myenv\Scripts\activate  # Windows # or source myenv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac`
    
3. **Install the dependencies**:
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    

### Building and Running the Docker Container

1. **Build the Docker image**:
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `docker build -t my-jupyter-image .`
    
2. **Run the Docker container**:
    
    sh
    
    Copy code
    
    `docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app my-jupyter-image`
    
3. **Access Jupyter Notebook**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8888`.
    

## Using the Subfolders

### Data Folder

- **data/raw/**: Store unprocessed or original data files. Use this folder to keep the initial state of the data intact for reproducibility.
- **data/processed/**: Store cleaned, transformed, or preprocessed data. This helps to avoid redoing time-consuming data cleaning steps.
- **data/external/**: Store data from third-party sources. This helps in organizing and citing sources properly.

### Notebooks Folder

- **notebooks/exploration/**: Use for exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks. These notebooks are used for initial data investigation and hypothesis generation.
- **notebooks/analysis/**: Use for in-depth analysis and modeling notebooks. These notebooks are focused on detailed analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- **notebooks/reports/**: Use for finalized notebooks intended for reporting. These notebooks are well-documented and include explanations and visualizations suitable for stakeholders.

### Scripts Folder

- **scripts/**: Use for Python scripts or other code files that perform data processing, analysis, and modeling. This is useful for automating tasks and running batch processes.

### Models Folder

- **models/**: Use for saving trained models and related files. This helps in organizing model artifacts for easy access and deployment.

## Example Workflow

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Place raw data files in `data/raw/`.
2. Create a new notebook in `notebooks/exploration/` to explore the raw data.

### Data Cleaning and Processing

1. Use a script or notebook to clean and preprocess the raw data.
2. Save the cleaned data in `data/processed/`.

### In-Depth Analysis and Modeling

1. Create notebooks in `notebooks/analysis/` to build and evaluate models using the processed data.
2. Save model artifacts (e.g., trained models, evaluation metrics) in `models/`.

### Reporting

1. Create a notebook in `notebooks/reports/` to present your findings, using visualizations and summaries.
2. Use this notebook to generate reports for stakeholders.

By following this structure and using the provided subfolders appropriately, you can maintain a clean and organized repository that supports efficient and effective data science workflows. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact the repository maintainers.
