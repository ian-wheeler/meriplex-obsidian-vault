| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ticket Triaging**               | Difficulty routing tickets to the appropriate board.                                                                    |
| **Automated Alerts**              | Unhelpful alerts, primarily from LightPoint and various sources, requiring investigation.                               |
| **Opportunity and Ticket Fields** | Necessity to bring over all required fields so the quoting team doesn't have to complete the opportunity details.       |
| **Ticket Naming**                 | Appending "ticket" to each ticket created is not useful.                                                                |
| **CPQ Terms & Conditions**        | Multiple `Terms & Conditions` and duplication issues, highlighted as a high priority.                                   |
| **CPQ Complexity**                | The CPQ system is considered "infinitely complicated," needing rework and a dedicated admin.                            |
| **Team Member Classification**    | Clarification needed on which team members are responsible for the quote, with a suggestion for a dedicated dispatcher. |
| **Quoting Specialists**           | Concerns over Quoting Specialists moving too slowly and needing higher volume.                                          |
| **Stylistic Alignment**           | Efforts to align the Order/Porter and Invoice PDF stylistically are significant.                                        |
| **Email Connector**               | Generating tickets on quoting boards with no linked opportunity, which should originate from Salesforce.                |
