## SF-CW-Integration-Documentation

### 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:**  Salesforce Connectwise Integration
**Project Manager:**  Ian Wheeler
**Date:**  2024-06-12
**Version:** 1.0

**Description:**  
The project aims to enhance sales efficiency by integrating Salesforce (SF) with ConnectWise Manage (CW). This integration will allow salespeople to focus more on sales and contact documentation by shifting CRM functions from CW to SF, utilizing SF's superior data validation features. In Phase 1, sales administration tasks like quoting and order processing will remain in CW. SF will be the primary system for initiating customer, contact, and opportunity data, with new fields and validation rules added to ensure data integrity. Intake forms in SF will capture detailed information upfront, reducing back-and-forth communication. The integration will enable seamless data flow between SF and CW, improving overall data accuracy and operational efficiency.
