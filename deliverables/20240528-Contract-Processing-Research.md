## Task Description

Brian Jones has requested a research task to explore the use of Microsoft Azure's Document Intelligence Studio. The primary goal is to determine if the prebuilt model for contracts can extract expiration dates from approximately 10 complex existing customer contracts.

## Objectives

- [x] Determine the feasibility of using Document Intelligence Studio for extracting contract expiration dates.
- [x] Upload and test 10 complex customer contracts.
- [ ] Evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the extracted expiration dates.

## Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - [ ] Ability to upload and process multiple contracts.
    - [ ] Accurate extraction of contract expiration dates.
    - [ ] User-friendly interface for uploading documents and retrieving results.

- **Non-functional Requirements:**
    - [ ] High processing speed.
    - [ ] Secure handling of sensitive contract data.
    - [ ] Compatibility with existing systems.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Detailed report on the feasibility and accuracy of using Document Intelligence Studio.
- [ ] A set of extracted expiration dates from the 10 test contracts.
- [ ] Recommendations for future use cases and potential integration with other systems.

## Milestones

1. [ ]  **Milestone 1:** Initial research and setup [Insert Date]
2. [ ]  **Milestone 2:** Upload and process test contracts [Insert Date]
3. [ ]  **Milestone 3:** Evaluation and reporting [Insert Date]

## Dependencies

| **Dependency**     | **Details**            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Prerequisites**  | Access to Document Intelligence Studio and test contracts |
| **Postrequisites** | Evaluation of results and report preparation |

## Risks and Mitigations

|**Risk**|**Mitigation**|
|---|---|
|Data security concerns| Ensure all data handling complies with company policies and regulations.|
|Inaccurate extraction results| Conduct multiple tests and refine the process as needed.|

## Resources

- **Team Members:**
    - Ian Wheeler
    - Brian Jones (for contract provision)

- **Tools & Technologies:**
    - Microsoft Azure Document Intelligence Studio

- **Budget:** No budget allocated; potential cost savings if successful.

## Progress Updates

|**Date**|**Progress**|**Issues**|**Next Steps**|
|---|---|---|---|
|[Update Date]|Initial setup and research conducted|None so far|Proceed with uploading and testing contracts|

## Notes

This task, if successful, could significantly reduce the time and effort required to manually review and extract data from contracts. Potential future use includes populating agreements in ConnectWise.
