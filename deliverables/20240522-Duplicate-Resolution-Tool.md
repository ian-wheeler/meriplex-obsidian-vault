## Task Description

Dusty Corning and Brian Jones have requested the development of a tool or application for Meriplex to identify and resolve duplicate accounts across various systems, with a primary focus on ConnectWise Manage and Salesforce. The tool should integrate with these systems, compare and identify duplicates using advanced algorithms, and provide options for resolving duplicates, including merging, marking as false positives, and flagging for manual review. Additionally, the tool should offer automated resolution features, detailed reporting, and ongoing synchronization capabilities.

## Objectives

- [ ]  Develop an application to connect with ConnectWise Manage and Salesforce via APIs or import/export features.
- [ ]  Implement data comparison techniques, including basic criteria and advanced algorithms.
- [ ]  Provide a user-friendly interface for reviewing and resolving duplicates.
- [ ]  Enable automated resolution options based on predefined rules.
- [ ]  Generate detailed reports on duplicate identification and resolution.
- [ ]  Ensure ongoing synchronization between systems to maintain data integrity.

## Requirements

- **Functional Requirements:**
    - [ ]  Integration with ConnectWise Manage and Salesforce via APIs.
    - [ ]  Ability to compare data using name, email, ID, and advanced algorithms like fuzzy matching or machine learning.
    - [ ]  Presentation of potential duplicates with filtering and sorting options.
    - [ ]  Resolution options for merging, marking as false positives, and flagging for manual review.
    - [ ]  Automated resolution based on predefined rules.
    - [ ]  Detailed reporting and analytics features.
    - [ ]  Continuous monitoring and synchronization between systems.

- **Non-functional Requirements:**
    - [ ]  High performance and accuracy in duplicate identification.
    - [ ]  User-friendly interface with intuitive navigation.
    - [ ]  Secure data handling and storage.
    - [ ]  Scalability to support future enhancements.

## Deliverables

- [ ]  Prototype of the duplicate account resolution tool.
- [ ]  Integrated APIs for ConnectWise Manage and Salesforce.
- [ ]  Functional user interface for duplicate identification and resolution.
- [ ]  Automated resolution workflows.
- [ ]  Comprehensive reporting and analytics module.
- [ ]  Documentation and user manual.
