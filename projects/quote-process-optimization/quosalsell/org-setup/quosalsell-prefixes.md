# Quote Prefixes Overview
---
Quote prefixes appear in the beginning of quote numbers on the Order Porter™ page, quote PDF, and opportunity name, enabling you to easily see which sales rep or which office branch created a specific quote when it is passed to your CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software. Quote prefixes do not display on the quote in ConnectWise CPQ™ and are not searchable. Prefixes can be added based on users, location or company profile. Refer to [Users](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/800/010/020 "Users") and [My User](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/800/010/010 "My User") documentation for more information. 

In addition to prefixes, the quote PDF name can be customized for individual quotes or for all quotes that are published. Prefixes are positioned before the custom PDF name. Read [Quote Setup - Settings](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/800/050/010 "Quote Setup - Settings") and [Quote Setup Screen](https://docs.connectwise.com/ConnectWise_Sell/300/020/010 "Quote Setup Screen") for more information. 

**Note:** Prefixes only apply to quotes created after adding a prefix setting and is not retroactive. Prefixes may not appear on all quote forms. Check your quote to confirm that prefixes are applied.
