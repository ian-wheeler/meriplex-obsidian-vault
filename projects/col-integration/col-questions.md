## Comments

- We want to notify the client at various stages in the quoting process. When?
	- When the quote is requested
	- When the quote is signed
	- When the order is delivered
	- When the process is completed
- We do not want to manually validate MRR v. NRR Cases in Salesforce
- All Meriplex employees should have have the location `Meriplex Solutions` set as their default on their member record, not `Meriplex Communications`.
## Concerns

1. What is going to be the syncing logic of the current custom integration developed between ConnectWise and Salesforce (accounting for the to-be quoting process)?
