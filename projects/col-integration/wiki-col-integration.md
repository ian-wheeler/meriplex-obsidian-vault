## Documentation & Planning
---
**Comprehensive Integration Assessment**: Undertake a detailed evaluation of the existing integrations across all systems, not limited to ConnectWise (CW) and Salesforce (SF). This evaluation aims to uncover opportunities for refactoring and optimization across the integration landscape to enhance operational efficiency and system interoperability.

**Documentation Requirements**: Essential documentation to facilitate the integration assessment, refactoring efforts, and future planning includes:

**Data Flow Diagrams (DFD's)**: Construct visual diagrams to map out the current data flows within and between all integrated systems. These diagrams serve as foundational tools for understanding existing architectures and pinpointing inefficiencies.
- **Current State (AS-IS)**
- **Future State (TO-BE)**

**Refactoring and Future Planning**: Based on the thorough assessment and detailed documentation, decide on the necessity and scope of refactoring the integration architecture. This decision-making process should consider the benefits of improved data management, reduced manual intervention, and alignment with best practices in system design, aiming for a streamlined, efficient, and scalable integration ecosystem.
