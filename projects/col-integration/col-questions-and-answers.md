1. We need visibility to pick items from inventory before we buy: 
	- Inventory lives in Connectwise
	- Q: How do we have visibility in COL for our inventory in CW
	- ***Q: Can we treat the inventory from CW as a Vendor?***
	
2. Do we have the ability to go back and forth with revision for quotes? 
	**NEEDED**

	- Procurement (Chris, Kelvin)
	- Sales (Dusty, Carrie),
	- Operations (John P.)
